Cache  Purge  is a  lightweight,  efficient  Drupal  module designed  to  manage
database cache  table sizes. It  automatically truncates cache tables  when they
exceed a  configurable size limit,  preventing unchecked growth that  can impact
site performance. The  module runs during cron, checks each  cache table's size,
and  clears  those  surpassing  the  set  threshold.  With  an  intuitive  admin
interface, users  can easily adjust the  size limit to suit  their site's needs.
Cache  Purge  also  logs  each truncation  event,  providing  valuable  insights
for  system administrators.  This  module  is ideal  for  sites struggling  with
large  cache tables,  offering a  simple solution  to maintain  optimal database
performance without manual intervention. Compatible with Drupal 9 and 10.
